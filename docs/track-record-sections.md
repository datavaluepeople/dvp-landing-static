## Client Images
To add new client images:
- Get the logo of the client in a png of jpeg/jpg format
- Add it to `content/assets/icons/clients`
- The file name should have a number to indicate the order
- Add the file name (without extension) to variable `linkNameMap` in `src/components/client-images/client-images.js` with the link being to the client's website.
- Check that it looks ok
