description: "Phoenix is an open-source AI platform developed by Build Up and datavaluepeople to
aid peacebuilding through social media analysis. Launched in January 2025, it addresses challenges
like large data processing, limited technical expertise, and under-resourced-language
classification. Key features include a user-friendly interface, secure authentication, data
scraping, and multi-language classification. Phoenix has already supported hundreds of
peacebuilders, processed terabytes of data, and gained recognition at the Paris Peace AI Forum. A
public-good platform, making advanced AI tools accessible for conflict analysis of digital spaces;
Phoenix exemplifies how collaboration and ethical AI can drive global peacebuilding efforts."

In a world where social media deeply shapes public opinion, data-driven insights can play a pivotal
role in preventing conflict and fostering peace. That’s exactly what [Build
Up](https://howtobuildup.org/phoenix/), a nonprofit dedicated to supporting peacebuilders—sought to
accomplish through Phoenix. Developed in partnership with datavaluepeople, Phoenix is an
open-source (code repository [here](https://gitlab.com/howtobuildup/phoenix)), end-to-end AI
powered platform designed to help peacebuilders and mediators, allowing them to analyze social
media discourses, informing effective strategies for conflict prevention and resolution. Since
January 2025 Phoenix has been open to the public and you can apply for a Phoenix account
[here](https://howtobuildup.org/phoenix/).

In this article, we’ll explore the challenges Build Up faced, the solutions datavaluepeople
provided, and how Phoenix is transforming social media analysis for peacebuilding around the globe.

***

## **The challenge: Leveraging social media for peacebuilding**

Peacebuilders and mediators increasingly look to social media to gauge public sentiment and
identify emerging tensions. Yet collecting and analyzing massive volumes of data from diverse
platforms is practically impossible. Several roadblocks stood in the way:

1. **Data overload**: Peacebuilders needed a reliable way to gather, organize, and filter vast
   streams of social media data.

2. **Limited technical expertise**: Many peacebuilders aren’t data scientists, so any AI-driven
   platform had to make analyzing social media discourses intuitive and accessible.

3. **Multi-language support, including under-resourced-languages**: Commercial social media
   analysis tools don't often support under-resourced languages or classification across multiple
   languages.

4. **Open-source requirement**: Build Up wanted to show the non-commercial nature of the project.
   Plus to make the technology transparent and to allowing others with technical expertise to
   collaborate and use it.

## **The solution: Phoenix — An AI powered Social Media analysis platform for peacebuilders**

Working closely with Build Up, datavaluepeople created Phoenix: a powerful, user-friendly system
that addresses each challenge in a single, comprehensive platform.

### **Modern web console**

Built with React and Next.js, Phoenix’s web console offers a straightforward interface accessible
from any device with an internet connection. It allows peacebuilders to collect social media data,
explore data points, easily configure analyses, and review insights without advanced technical
skills.

### **Authentication and dashboarding**

Phoenix’s authentication system ensures secure access, while its Superset-based dashboards make
data visualization highly flexible. Users can build interactive charts and graphs that help surface
trends or spikes in conflict-related discussions—providing clarity on community sentiment and
emerging risks.

### **Data scraping integration**

By integrating with data-scraping platforms like Apify, Phoenix streamlines large-scale data
collection from social media and other online sources. It lets users define specific parameters for
what data to capture, helping them focus on the most relevant content while honouring platform and
data privacy policies.

### **Classification systems for all (Unicode-supported) languages**

A standout feature is Phoenix’s multi-language classification engine, which manages high- and
low-resource languages alike. This ensures peacebuilders can quickly identify posts of
interest—crucial when sifting through huge volumes of potentially conflict-related material.

***

## **How it works**

1. **Gather**: Peacebuilders specify keywords, locations, or other criteria for collecting data
   from social media and other sources such as [ACLED](https://acleddata.com/).

2. **Classify**: Phoenix’s machine learning models process the incoming data, identifying critical
   topics, trends, and sentiments.

3. **Explore**: Users start with a standard dashboard and then tailor visualizations to track
   data trends they are interested.

4. **Collaborate & share**: Being open-source, Phoenix allows contributors worldwide to enhance its
   capabilities—ensuring continued evolution and impact. As well as increasing the transparency and
   accessibility of social media analysis for a positive impact.

## **The results: A global impact on peacebuilding**

Since launch, Phoenix has proven invaluable for peacebuilders worldwide, yielding several
noteworthy outcomes:

1. **Global reach**: Versions v1 and v2 of Phoenix have supported hundreds of peacebuilders,
   allowing them to analyze social media discourses and develop targeted interventions. Including
   being one of the 31 projects (of 770 applicants) accepted into the [Paris Peace
   Forum](https://www.elysee.fr/en/sommet-pour-l-action-sur-l-ia/2024/10/24/call-for-projects-from-the-paris-peace-forum-a-growing-interest-in-addressing-global-challenges-through-ai).

2. **Massive data handling at low cost**: Phoenix has processed terabytes of social media data,
   managing the scale more commonly associated with large tech firms than small nonprofits. With
   the platform, that Build Up and datavaluepeople maintain, being free for small organisations
   that make a positive impact.

3. **Real insights**: By revealing the narratives driving online discussion, Phoenix enables
   quicker, more evidence-based decision-making. Case studies can be found in the [Phoenix
   manual](https://www.notion.so/howtobuildup/Case-studies-cd8ace41995a479a820c3f722532440c).

4. **Public good platform launch**: Scheduled for 2025, Phoenix will be offered as a public-good
   platform, bringing large-scale data analytics to even more communities and organizations. Read

## **Conclusion**

It has been a rewarding journey collaborating with Build Up on Phoenix. Together we have found a
way to balance a “sticks and chewing gum” approach to rapidly deliver working solutions on a
limited budget while still ensuring that peacebuilders have robust, maintainable, and transparent
technology at their fingertips. There’s a great deal of satisfaction in creating something that
communities worldwide can not only use but also improve upon—knowing it might help prevent conflict
and foster dialogue. We’re excited for Phoenix to continue evolving, flourishing, and positively
impacting peacebuilding efforts for years to come.
